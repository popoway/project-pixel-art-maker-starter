## Requirements

Your users should be able to:

1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
2. Choose a color.
3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

Your primary task is to implement the `makeGrid()` function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

In this project, you'll use your front-end programming skills from __JavaScript Foundations__ and __Intro to jQuery__. Although not a requirement, you are encouraged to use __jQuery__ to manipulate the DOM for this project.

## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

You can download the starter code through: [The Pixel Art Maker repository on GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter)
